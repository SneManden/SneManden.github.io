The base of the game will\nprobably be from some existing game/engine I have used before. If I do 3D\nI will use code from my most recent game, <a href=\"/spil/foxescape\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foxescape</a>.\nElse, I will probably use something like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SneManden/carGame\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this car game engine</a> as a base.</p>\n<p>My prefered graphics tool is <a href=\"http://www.getpaint.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paint.NET</a>, but I am on\nLinux so I use the slightly more unstable and buggy\n<a href=\"http://pinta-project.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinta</a>, a Paint.NET open-source clone.</p>\n<p>I have very poor experince with sound-effect/music creation, so I&#39;ll go for\n<a href=\"http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sfxr</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bfxr.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bfxr</a>\nfor the sound effects and probably use some free background music from around\nthe web.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates\">Updates</h2>\n<p>I plan on using this blogpost for updates, as I progress through the\ncompetition. So stay tuned! You can follow my progress on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">github</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"finished-24--235500\">Finished! (24 + 23:55:00)</h3>\n<p>So, I am out of time! I have just submitted the game here:\n<a href=\"https://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-08/334/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Save Otto Griffis</a>.\nI will set up the game on my website (so you do not have to download from\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">github</a>, and then I will go\nstraight to bed!)</p>\n<p>Also, I&#39;d like to give proper attribution to the authors (or license holders)\nof the music that I have used in my game:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/unreal_dm/32234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">When I Open My Eyes by unreal_dm (featuring Admiral Bob)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/hansatom/34108\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DJ Death by Hans Atom (featuring Kara!)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can play my game at <a href=\"http://saveottogriffis.snemanden.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">saveottogriffis.snemanden.com</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-19_23:45:00.png\" alt=\"Start screen with instructions and objective\" title=\"Start screen with instructions and objective\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-19_23:46:00.png\" alt=\"Find and press this button, and hell breaks lose!\" title=\"Find and press this button, and hell breaks lose!\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-19_23:48:00.png\" alt=\"Save Otto Griffis (stage performer, in blue) while avoiding/defeating zombie ladies\" title=\"Save Otto Griffis (stage performer, in blue) while avoiding/defeating zombie ladies\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"you-can-now-win-the-game-24h--170500\">You can now win the game! (24h + 17:05:00)</h3>\n<p>Yes, you read that right! I just added a line of code that checks whether some\ncondition is fulfilled; if so, you win the game! Well, I must admit, that right\nnow you get that message through a subtle console-message, and yeah, nothing\nelse.</p>\n<p>I am quickly running out of time, so I should really focus on doing some simple\nsound-effects, create the menu/starting screen, create a game-over and a &quot;you\nhave beat the frickin&#39; game&quot;-screen. Gosh, much to do.</p>\n<p>Also, the game is becomming quite heavy. The amount of</p>\n<pre><code>for (var i in this.game.entities)\n    // Do something</code></pre>\n<p>is greater than I care to admit. (The number of times that I iterate every\nentity in the game; sometimes done every frame for every entity...)</p>\n<p>But here is the most recent screenshot!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-19_17:00:00.png\" alt=\"Yeah, the performer went for the door!

Should be save and sound behind that\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"a-new-character-is-introduced-24h--122500\">A new character is introduced! (24h + 12:25:00)</h3>\n<p>So I have spent the first few hours of this day (got out of bed at ~09) by\nrefining the behaviour of the zombies and: created a new character!\nSo please welcome the man in blue. He is supposed to be a VIP character, that\nthe player has to protect; well, that is the plan for now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-19_12:19:00.png\" alt=\"The stage performer is here! And with a fancy shirt too!\" title=\"The stage performer is here! And with a fancy shirt too!\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"day-1-over-24h--020500\">Day 1 over (24h + 02:05:00)</h3>\n<p>So, that was the first 24 hours! I am not entirely sure that I am happy with\nthe progress, that I have managed so far. Complaints, complaints...\nAt least I have not had any serious bugs or problems.</p>\n<p>At some point I realized, that the graphics was crisp, and yes, setting the\npixel-scale to &quot;nearest neighbour&quot; fixed that.\nAlthough I can still manage to have a decent framerate with &gt;500 entities,\nimplementing a naive collision-detection with obstacles will probably have\nan impact soon. I guess I use way too much memory and way too ineficient\nalgorithms, but I can&#39;t bother optimizing those things. This is an 48 hour\ngame, not a Computer Science project!</p>\n<p>I cannot really say that I have figured out the story yet. That should be\none of the main goals for tomorrow. And how do you win? Killing all of them?</p>\n<p>Here are some screens to show some of the progress I have made:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-18_23:17:30.png\" alt=\"New textures\" title=\"New textures\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-19_01:58:00.png\" alt=\"Obstacles, collisions, yeeesss\" title=\"Obstacles, collisions, yeeesss\"></p>\n<p>(The zombie closest to the player can not move any further downwards:\nit is suppesed to be obscured by the white platform. When I add stairs, that\nshould be more clear, I hope.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"grandma-zombies-195000\">Grandma zombies? (19:50:00)</h3>\n<p>After a ~4 hour break with lots of fresh air and social gardening, I have\nreturned to the keyboard.</p>\n<p>The game will maybe, maybe not feature zombies and/or cute ponies. The story\nI&#39;ll save for later. But here are some screenshots of the development for the\nlast few hours:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-18_19:27:00.png\" alt=\"Friendly old ladies...\" title=\"Friendly old ladies...\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-18_19:10:00.png\" alt=\"That turn into hostile zombies!\" title=\"That turn into hostile zombies!\"></p>\n<p>I&#39;ll grab a bite, before I&#39;m at it again...</p>\n<h3 id=\"it-begins-120500\">It begins (12:05:00)</h3>\n<p>So I have come up with some vague idea. A hack-n-slash game with lots of enemies\n(original, I know).</p>\n<p>Not much time to say so much; have been doing simple setup and begun with\nanimations and player movement.</p>\n<p>I will have a break for a few hours and do some gardening: fresh air.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-18_10:51:57.png\" alt=\"Just getting started\" title=\"Just getting started\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SneManden/BaconGameJam08Entry/master/screens/2014-10-18_11:57:00.png\" alt=\"Ooops, saved as low-quality png\" title=\"Ooops, saved as as low-quality png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"millions-of-them-081000\">&quot;Millions of them&quot; (08:10:00)</h3>\n<p>The theme of this game jam event turned out to be &quot;Millions of them&quot;.</p>\n<p>I stayed up until midnight, read the theme, brushed my teeth and went to bed.\nNow that I am up, I will brainstorm a bit and hopefully soon reach some kind of\nconclusion as to what game I am going to make.</p>\n","excerpt":"I am in!
