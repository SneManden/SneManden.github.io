I found that\nothers played and approached my game quite differently than I had in mind.\nSome things were not as obvious as I imagined when designing the game.\n(Keep in mind, it was created within 48 hours, so not <em>that</em> much thought has\nbeen given to this aspect.)</p>\n<p>My strategy is to lurk the zombies down to the white stage, where I like to\nkeep Otto safe and sound. Then I sprint up on the stage, and kill the zombies\nfrom there. They can still kill you, if you get too close to the border, but\nyou, the player, actually has a slight larger range of attack than the zombies,\nso it is possible to stay in a spot where you can hit them, but they can&#39;t hit\nyou.</p>\n<video controls style=\"width:100%;\">\n  <source src=\"/media/arkiv/beating-save-otto-griffis/saveOttoGriffis-letsplay.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\">\n  <source src=\"/media/arkiv/beating-save-otto-griffis/saveOttoGriffis-letsplay.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n</video>\n\n<p>I recorded this video with\n<a href=\"http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gtk-recordMyDesktop</a>,\nand used <code>ffmpeg</code> to add an <code>.mp4</code> source (along with original <code>.ogg</code> file).\nI used the Firefox webbrowser to play the game in the video. Chromium was used\nwhen developing the game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts\">Thoughts</h2>\n<p>So, creating this game and watching others play it has learnt me a few things,\nand from the feedback in the comments for example, I am cleverer to as what\nworks in this game, and what doesn&#39;t.</p>\n<h3 id=\"negative--improve\">Negative / improve</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Confusing that Otto often dies suddenly, if you do not <em>sprint</em> down and\nkill the zombies that might have spawned near him.</li>\n<li>Although it plays smoothely most places I have tested, it <em>is</em> resource\nheavy and in a let&#39;s play, the game was nearly unplayable when screen-recording was enabled.</li>\n<li>Written text (font) does not fit visual style. (When I implemented it,\nI didn&#39;t have time to draw my own bitmap font.)</li>\n<li>Still mises some sounds/music (e.g. at gameover/win and menu).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"positive\">Positive</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The music-change when hitting the button seemed cool.</li>\n<li>I am satisfied with the graphics; given my art-skills and that I am still\nlearning the ways of pixel art, I am satisfied with the sprites and visual\nfeel of the game.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-would-like-to-learn--do-better-next-time\">What I would like to learn / do better next time</h2>\n<p>I have some thoughts on what I&#39;d like to experiment with next.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimization: e.g. only drawing/handling objects within viewport.</li>\n<li>Be more cleverer about level-design and creation.</li>\n<li>Write a common framework from the most recent games/experiments that uses\npixi.js. Especially the <code>Game</code> object and an <code>Entity</code> super-class with\ncommonly used methods and attributes used by all entities.</li>\n<li>Try creating a mobile-friendly game (touch controls)!</li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"I recently entered and submitted a game to the\n<a href=\"https://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BaconGameJam08</a> with my\ngame <a href=\"https://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-08/334/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Save Otto Griffis</a>.\nHere I discuss my game, and show my very own lets&#39; play where you see my beat\nthe game.","title":"Beating \"Save Otto Griffis\"","author":"Casper Kehlet Jensen","description":"Here I show how to beat my own game, Save Otto Griffis, my entry to the BaconGameJam08.","warning":null,"draft":false,"published":{"year":2014,"month":10,"date":23,"timestamp":"2014-10-23"},"hide":false,"gallery_name":null,"gallery_position":"top","gallery":null}
