{"slug":"running-visualizer","html":"<p>After a successful half marathon first Sunday this month, I really came to\nrealize how much I love and enjoy running.

My game development skills are\na bit rusty, and I choose to use <a href=\"https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pixi.js</a>\nas rendering engine, which is quite bare bones (not a complete game framework,\nrather lightweight engine / library).\nAlso, <em>Javascript</em>. Enough said.</p>\n<p>I would have liked to add nicer graphics, especially regarding the background\nand atmosphere. The background is great, but does not quite have the right\ndimensions for a proper parallax scrolling background. More background layers\nof varying distances would be awesome.</p>\n","excerpt":"After a successful half marathon first Sunday this month, I really came to\nrealize how much I love and enjoy running.
