I tried copying and/or symlinking those\nfiles between various places in my <code>/usr/share</code> but it didn&#39;t work.</p>\n<p>However, a quick result from the vast Internet yield\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/The-solution-of-lacking-libudev.so.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this result</a>.</p>\n<p>As I didn&#39;t understand the bash-file corresponding to the first solution\n(at first glance) I skipped that.</p>\n<p>The second was just to apply the following command</p>\n<pre><code>sed -i &#39;s/udev\\.so\\.0/udev.so.1/g&#39; piskel</code></pre>\n<p>Hmm, what does it do? Apparently it modifies the binary itself, replacing\nany reference to <code>udev.so.0</code> by <code>udev.so.1</code>\n(that&#39;s the regular expression part)! And it turned out to work out!\nFirst time I ever used <code>sed</code>. Awesome.</p>\n<p>Now I will check out this app, and see whether it can compete with\nPinta and Kolourpaint, which are my prefered graphics tools.\n(The best tool that worked for me is Paint.NET, and remember: I&#39;m on Linux.)</p>\n","excerpt":"So, I recently heard of this webapp for pixel art and animation,\n<a href=\"http://www.piskelapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Piskel</a>, and I had a few spare minutes,\nso I tried to run it as a desktop application too &mdash;\njust for the heck of it.\n(Of course it should be noted, that I could still\njust use the app in the browser, no problem there.)","title":"Running piskel","author":"Casper Kehlet Jensen","description":"How I got to run Piskel on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04)","warning":null,"draft":false,"published":{"year":2014,"month":10,"date":26,"timestamp":"2014-10-26"},"hide":false,"gallery_name":null,"gallery_position":"top","gallery":null}
